The histological subtypes of osteosarcoma were chondrob-\nlastic (n=5; Table 1, nos. 1, 2, 6, 8, 9), osteoblastic (n=3, nos. 3, 4,\n7), and telangiectatic (n=1, no. 5). In rhabdomyosarcoma, the\nhistological subtypes were alveolar (n=3, nos. 17, 18, 20) and\npleomorphic (n=2, nos. 19, 21). Patients with malignant lymphoma\nwere excluded from this study because malignant lymphoma is a\nsystemic disease. Two cases of plasmacytoma were both of the\nsolitary type, therefore these cases were included.\nSurgical resection (S) alone was carried out in 15 patients.\nTriple modality of S, radiation therapy (R) and chemotherapy (C)\nwas performed in 6, combined therapy of S/C in 4, and S/R was in\n4. We judged that the primary tumors were unresectable in three\ncases; therefore combined therapy of R and C was given to these 3\npatients. Radiation therapy was given preoperatively in 6 cases,\npostoperatively in 3 and both in 1. The doses used varied from 18 to\n80 Gy, with an average of 48 Gy. All radiation therapy was extemal\nirradiation. The fraction sizes were 2.5 Gy, treating 4\nweek. Chemotherapy was given preoperatively in 8\npostoperatively in 2. The chemotherapy regimens were varied,\nTreatment was determined according to the experience of the\nsurgeon. This resulted in a lack of unity in the treatment protocol.\nThe common agents were cisplatin (n=5), 5-fluorouracil (n=4), and\ndoxorubicin (n=4). The regional intra-arterial infusion chemother-\napy administered via the superficial temporal artery was given in 9\nof 11 patients who had sarcoma of the maxilla, maxillary sinus, or\n\nthe temporomandibular fossa. The survival rate and survival curve\nwere calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method using SPSS for\nWindows, version 10.\n\nResults\n\nFourteen patients of 32 were making satisfactory progress\nwithout local recurrence or metastasis at a mean follow-up\nperiod of 8.5 years, ranging from 2 years 3 months to\n19 years. Local recurrence was found in 10 cases (31%)\nand metastasis in 11 (34%). Among 10 patients with local\nrecurrence, 3 are alive after 6-17 years, and 7 died of their\ntumors after 5 months to 4 years. Among the 3 patients\nalive, one (no. 3) was treated by surgery and the other (no.\n17) by surgery and postoperative radiation therapy (50 Gy)\nafter local recurrence was found. These two patients are\nalive without evidence of disease over 3 years and 7 years\nafter salvage treatment. Another patient (no. 5) was treated\nby preoperative radiation therapy (45 Gy) and surgery for\nlocal recurrence. The local recurrence was controlled, but\nthis patient developed distant metastasis to the lung.\n\nThe 5-year survival rate of patient with local recurrence\nwas 30% (Fig. 1). Among 11 patients with metastases 9 died\n"
