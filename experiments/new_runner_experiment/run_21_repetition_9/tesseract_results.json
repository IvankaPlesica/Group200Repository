Thus, let 1 < k < n and C7 be the number of subsets of A with k\nelements.\n\nFor a fixed x € A, there are two kinds of subsets of A with k elements: those\nwhich do not contain x and those which do contain x. The former ones are precisely\nthe k-element subsets of A \\ {x}; since |A \\ {x}| = — 1, there are exactly cr! of\nthese subsets of k elements of A.\n\nOn the other hand, if B C A has k elements and x € B, then B \\ {x} C A \\ {x}\nhas k—1 elements; conversely, if B’ C A\\{x} has k—1 elements, then B’U{x} C A\nhas k elements, one of which is x. Since such correspondences are clearly inverses\nof each other, we conclude that there are as many k-element subsets of A containing\nx, as there are k — | element subsets of A \\ {x}; thus, there are exactly Crt such\nk-element subsets of A.\n\nTaking these two contributions into account, we obtain for 1 < k < n the\nrecurrence relation\n\ncreep t+ cr.\n\nwhich is identical to Stifel’s relation for the binomial numbers ()- Finally, since\nCp = 1 = (4) and C} =n = (‘) (for A has exactly n subsets of 1 element each—\nthe sets {x}, with x € A), an easy induction gives C? = (7) for0 <k <n. d\n\nIn words, the previous proposition computes how many are the unordered choices\nof k distinct elements of a set having n elements; one uses to say that such choices\nare the combinations of n objects, taking k at a time.
