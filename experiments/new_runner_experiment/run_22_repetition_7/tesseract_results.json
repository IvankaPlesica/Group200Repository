West leads a club, East\nwinning dummy’s queen with\nthe ace. East, diagnosing the lead\nas a possible singleton, returns\nthe three of clubs, ruffed by West\nwith the deuce.\n\nEast’s return of the three,\nrather than just any club, is\nconventional. It says that, as be-\ntween hearts and diamonds, he\nwould prefer that West lead the\nlower-ranking suit next. (Had\nEast preferred a heart return, he\nwould have led the eight of clubs\nto ask for the higher-ranking\nsuit.)\n\nAccordingly, West leads the\ndiamond three to East’s queen\nand South’s ace. Declarer plays\na trump to dummy’s jack and\nEast’s ace, and now East has a\ngenuine problem.\n\nIf he thinks West has another\ntrump, East should return a club;\nbut if he thinks West has no more\ntrumps, his best chance is a dia-\nmond return. With only his own\n13 cards to rely on, East might\neasily go wrong and hand South\nthe contract. But another con-\nvention, the trump echo, comes\nto his rescue.\n\nWest’s ruff with the two\nof spades, followed later by the\nplay of the four, denies a hold-\ning of three trumps. If West had\nstarted with the 6-4-2, for ex-\nample, he would have ruffed\nthe club at trick two with the\nfour and later played the deuce\nto indicate possession of a third\ntrump.\n\nEast therefore returns a dia-\nmond at trick five, and four\nspades goes down two. With a\nclub return, South makes the\ncontract.\n"
