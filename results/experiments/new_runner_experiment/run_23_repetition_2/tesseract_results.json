West leads a club, East\nwinning dummy’s queen with\nthe ace. East, diagnosing the lead\nas a possible singleton, returns\nthe three of clubs, ruffed by West\nwith the deuce.\n\nEast’s return of the three,\nrather than just any club, is\nconventional. It says that, as be-\ntween hearts and diamonds, he\nwould prefer that West lead the\nlower-ranking suit next. (Had\nEast preferred a heart return, he\nwould have led the eight of clubs\nto ask for the higher-ranking\nsuit.)\n\nAccordingly, West leads the\ndiamond three to East’s queen\nand South’s ace. Declarer plays\na trump to dummy’s jack and\nEast’s ace, and now East has a\ngenuine problem.\n\nIf he thinks West has another\ntrump, East should return a club;\nbut if he thinks West has no more\ntrumps, his best chance is a dia-\nmond return. With only his own\n13 cards to rely on, East might\neasily go wrong and hand South\nthe contract. But another con-\nvention, the trump echo, comes\nto his rescue.\n\nWest’s ruff with the two\nof spades, followed later by the\nplay of the four, denies a hold-\ning of three trumps. If West had\nstarted with the 6-4-2, for ex-\nample, he would have ruffed\nthe club at trick two with the\nfour and later played the deuce\nto indicate possession of a third\ntrump.\n\nEast therefore returns a dia-\nmond at trick five, and four\nspades goes down two. With a\nclub return, South makes the\ncontract.\n"

    "pred": "The Guardian Wednesday 8 January 2025\n\n4 Opinion\n\nAnextinction-\n\nlevel reversal for\ntruth-seeking\n\nChris\nStokel-Walker\n\nocial media has always acted as\nsomething of a funhouse mirror to\nsociety as a whole. The algorithms\nand amplifications of an always online\nexistence have helped accentuate the\nworst parts of our lives, while tucking\nin and hiding the best. It’s part of\n\nwhy we’re so polarised today.\n\nWhich is what makes a declaration by one titan of\nbig tech this week so worrying. Less than two weeks\nbefore Donald Trump returns to the White House,\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, WhatsApp,\nInstagram and Threads, has made major changes to\ncontent moderation, and in doing so appears to align\nitself with the views of the incoming president.\n\nIna bizarre video message posted to his personal\n\nFacebook page yesterday, Meta’s chief executive\nofficer, Mark Zuckerberg, announced that the\nplatform is getting rid of its factcheckers. In their place?\nMobrule.\n\nZuckerberg has said that the platform, which has\nmore than 3 billion people worldwide logging on to its\napps every day, will be adopting an Elon Musk-style\ncommunity notes format for policing what is and isn’t\nacceptable speech on its platforms. Starting in the US,\nthe company will be dramatically shifting the Overton\nwindow towards whoever can shout the loudest.\n\nThe Meta CEO all but admitted that the move was\npolitically motivated. “It’s time to get back to our\nroots around free expression,” he said, confessing that\n“restrictions on topics like immigration and gender\n[...] are out of touch with mainstream discourse”.\n\nHe admitted to past “censorship mistakes” - here,\nprobably meaning the past four years of tamping\ndown political speech while a Democratic president\nwas in office - and said he would “work with President\nTrump to push back against foreign governments\ngoing after American companies to censor more”.\n\nThe most dog-whistle comment was a throwaway\nremark that Meta would be moving what remained of\nits trust and safety and content moderation teams out\nof liberal California, and its US content moderation\nwould now be based in staunchly Republican Texas.\n\nTo be completely clear: all businesspeople make\nshrewd moves to accommodate the changing\npolitical weather. But few people’s decisions matter *\n\nmore than Zuckerberg’s. He has found himself, in Chris\n\nthe past 21 years, a central part of western society. Stokel-Walker\n\nWhere Meta goes, the world - both online and offline is the author of\n\n- follows. And Meta has just decided to take a drastic, TikTok Boom:\n\ndramatic handbrake turn to the right. The Inside Story\nDon’t believe me - believe the watchdogs. “Meta’s of the World’s\n\nannouncement today is a retreat from any sane and Favourite App\n\nsafe approach to content moderation,” said the\nReal Facebook Oversight Board, an independent,\nself-appointed arbiter of Meta’s moves.\n\nOutrage and lies can spread easily on social\nmedia, and have only been kept partly in check by\nplatforms’ ability to intervene when things get out\nof hand. Social networks have always struggled to\nmoderate speech. Those platforms haven’t helped\nthemselves with chronic underinvestment in favour\nof growing their business at all costs. They have\nlong said effective moderation is an unsolvable\nissue of scale, but it’s a problem they created with\nan untrammelled pursuit of scale at all costs.\n\nCertainly, policing online discourse is difficult,\nand certainly, content moderation at the level firms\nlike Meta have been trying to operate has not worked.\nBut forswearing it entirely in favour of community\nnotes is not the answer. Suggesting that it is a rational,\nevidence-based decision hides the reality: this is\nan expedient move for a man who this week saw\nthe departure of a self-described “radical” centrist,\nNick Clegg, as his global policy chiefin favour ofa\nRepublican-leaning one. And who also appointed\nDana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship\nCEO and close Trump ally, to Meta’s board.\n\nIn many ways, you can’t blame Zuckerberg for\nbending the knee to Donald Trump. The problem\nis his decision has huge ramifications. This is an\nextinction-level event for the idea of objective truth\non social media - an organism that was already on\nlife support, but was clinging on in part because\nMeta was willing to fund independent factchecking\norganisations in order to try to maintain some\nelement of truthfulness, free from political bias.\nNight is day. Up is down. Meta is X. Mark Zuckerberg\nis Elon Musk. Buckle up for a turbulent, vitriolic\nand fact-free four years online.\n"

Abstract\n\nForm BE-140, Benchmark Survey of\nmsurance Transactions by U.S.\nnsurance Companies with Foreign\nPersons, obtains annual data from all\nU.S. insurance companies that engage in\nthe following international insurance\ntransactions: (1) Premiums earned on\nreinsurance assumed from insurance\ncompanies resident abroad; (2) losses\nincurred on reinsurance assumed from\ninsurance companies resident abroad;\n(3) premiums earned on primary\ninsurance sold to foreign persons; (4)\nlosses incurred on primary insurance\nsold to foreign persons; (5) premiums\nincurred on reinsurance ceded to\n\ninsurance companies resident abroad;\n(6) losses recovered on reinsurance\nceded to insurance companies resident\nabroad; (7) receipts for auxiliary\ninsurance services; and (8) payments for\nauxiliary insurance services. In\naddition, insurance companies with\ntransactions in at least one of the eight\ncategories listed above that exceed $2\nmillion must supply country specific\ndata on the amount of their insurance\ntransactions for each category.\n\nThe data are needed to monitor U.S.\ninternational trade in insurance\nservices, analyze its impact on the U.S.\neconomy and foreign economies,\ncompile and improve the U.S. economic\naccounts, support U.S. commercial\npolicy on insurance services, conduct\ntrade promotion, and improve the\nability of U.S. businesses to identify and\nevaluate market opportunities.\n\nThis survey is conducted at five year\nintervals; it was last conducted for 2008\nand will be conducted again for 2013.\nThe 2013 survey will be sent to\nrespondents on March 30, 2014 and\nreports are due by June 30, 2014.\n\nTwo changes are proposed to the 2013\nBE-140 form: (1) drop questions on\nfinite reinsurance because finite\nreinsurance is a dated concept that is no\nlonger relevant, and (2) add questions to\nidentify the transaction code, size, type\nand nature of large and irregular\ntransactions, defined as those contracts\nwith premiums ceded or assumed in\nexcess of $1 billion and that are at least\nthree times the size of a reporter’s\naverage regular contract. The new\ninformation will allow BEA to measure\nmore accurately insurance services on\nan accrual basis and to exclude\ntransactions that are not related to\ninsurance services.\n\nII. Method of Collection\n\nThe surveys are sent to the\nrespondents by U.S. mail and are also\navailable from the BEA Web site.\nRespondents may return the surveys one\nof four ways: U.S. mail, electronically\nusing BEA’s electronic collection system\n(eFile), fax, or email.\n\nIll.

    "pred": "Federal Register/Vol. 69, No. 157/Monday, August 16, 2004/Rules and Regulations\n\n50291\n\n207,638 tons of free tonnage raisins\nacquired by handlers from producers\nthrough the week ending June 19, 2004,\nplus 129,345 tons of 2002-03 carryin NS\nand Oleate inventory, equates to\n398,009 tons of natural condition\nraisins, or 373,117 tons of packed\nraisins, that are available to handlers for\nfree use or primary markets. This is\nalmost 130 percent of the quantity of NS\nraisins shipped during the 2002-03 crop\nyear (305,133 natural condition tons or\n286,260 packed tons). (Oleates were\nincluded in this computation because,\nas previously stated, Oleates were\ncombined with the NS varietal type\nbeginning with the 2003-04 crop year.)\nIn addition to the 10 plus 10 offers,\n\n§ 989.67(j) of the order provides\nauthority for sales of reserve raisins to\nhandlers under certain conditions such\nas a national emergency, crop failure,\nchange in economic or marketing\nconditions, inadequate carryover, or if\nree tonnage shipments in the current\ncrop year exceed shipments of a\ncomparable period of the prior crop\nyear. Such reserve raisins may be sold\nby handlers to any market. When\nimplemented, the additional offers of\nreserve raisins make even more raisins\navailable to primary markets, which is\nconsistent with USDA’s Guidelines.\n\nThe Committee plans to offer 5,714\ntons of 2002-03 NS reserve raisins for\nsale to handlers for free use pursuant to\n§ 989.67(j). Free tonnage deliveries as of\nJune 19, 2004, were 207,638 tons, which\nis 3,855 tons below the 211,493-ton\ntrade demand. Offering 3,855 tons of\nreserve raisins for sale to handlers for\nfree use would allow the industry to\nmake available the full 211,493-ton\ntrade demand. Free tonnage shipments\nfrom August 2003 through May 2004 are\n1,859 tons greater than free tonnage\nshipments during the same period last\nyear. Adding the 1,859 tons to the 3,855\ntons equates to a total of 5,714 tons of\nreserve being offered to handlers for free\nuse under § 989.67(j) of the order.\n\nFinal Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\n\nPursuant to requirements set forth in\nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the\nAgricultural Marketing Service (AMS)\nhas considered the economic impact of\nthis action on small entities.\nAccordingly, AMS has prepared this\nfinal regulatory flexibility analysis.\n\nThe purpose of the RFA is to fit\nregulatory actions to the scale of\nbusiness subject to such actions in order\nthat small businesses will not be unduly\nor disproportionately burdened.\nMarketing orders issued pursuant to the\nAct, and rules issued thereunder, are\nunique in that they are brought about\nthrough group action of essentially\n\nsmall entities acting on their own\nbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small\nentity orientation and compatibility.\n\nThere are approximately 20 handlers\nof California raisins who are subject to\nregulation under the order and\napproximately 4,500 raisin producers in\nthe regulated area. Small agricultural\nservice firms are defined by the Small\nBusiness Administration (13 CFR\n121.201) as those having annual receipts\nof less than $5,000,000, and small\nagricultural producers are defined as\nthose having annual receipts of less than\n$750,000. Thirteen of the 20 handlers\nsubject to regulation have annual sales\nestimated to be at least $5,000,000, and\nthe remaining 7 handlers have sales less\nthan $5,000,000. No more than 7\nhandlers, and a majority of producers, of\nCalifornia raisins may be classified as\nsmall entities.\n\nSince 1949, the California raisin\nindustry has operated under a Federal\nmarketing order. The order contains\nauthority to, among other things, limit\nthe portion of a given year’s crop that\ncan be marketed freely in any outlet by\nraisin handlers. This volume control\nmechanism is used to stabilize supplies\nand prices and strengthen market\nconditions.\n\nPursuant to § 989.54(d) of the order,\nthis rule continues in effect final\nvolume regulation percentages for 2003—\n04 crop NS raisins. The volume\nregulation percentages are 70 percent\nfree and 30 percent reserve. Free\ntonnage raisins may be sold by handlers\nto any market. Reserve raisins must be\nheld in a pool for the account of the\nCommittee and are disposed of through\ncertain programs authorized under the\norder.\n\nVolume regulation is warranted this\nseason for NS raisins because\nacquisitions of 296,625 tons through the\nweek ending June 19, 2004, combined\nwith the carryin inventory of 129,345\ntons, results in a total available supply\nof 425,970 tons, which is about 200\npercent higher than the 211,493-ton\ntrade demand. (Oleate inventory was\nincluded in this computation because,\nas previously stated, Oleates were\ncombined with the NS varietal type\nbeginning with the 2003-04 crop year.)\n\nThe current volume regulation\nprocedures have helped the industry\naddress its marketing problems by\nkeeping supplies in balance with\ndomestic and export market needs, and\nstrengthening market conditions. The\ncurrent volume regulation procedures\nfully supply the domestic and export\nmarkets, provide for market expansion,\nand help reduce the burden of\noversupplies in the domestic market.\n\nRaisin grapes are a perennial crop, so\nproduction in any year is dependent\nupon plantings made in earlier years.\nThe sun-drying method of producing\nraisins involves considerable risk\nbecause of variable weather patterns.\n\nEven though the product and the\nindustry are viewed as mature, the\nindustry has experienced considerable\nchange over the last several decades.\nBefore the 1975-76 crop year, more than\n50 percent of the raisins were packed\nand sold directly to consumers. Now,\nover 60 percent of raisins are sold in\nbulk. This means that raisins are now\nsold to consumers mostly as an\ningredient in another product such as\ncereal and baked goods. In addition, for\na few years in the early 1970’s, over 50\npercent of the raisin grapes were sold to\nthe wine market for crushing. Since\nthen, the percent of raisin-variety grapes\nsold to the wine industry has decreased.\n\nCalifornia’s grapes are classified into\nthree groups—table grapes, wine grapes,\nand raisin-variety grapes. Raisin-variety\ngrapes are the most versatile of the three\ntypes. They can be marketed as fresh\ngrapes, crushed for juice in the\nproduction of wine or juice concentrate,\nor dried into raisins. Annual\nfluctuations in the fresh grape, wine,\nand concentrate markets, as well as\nweather-related factors, cause\nfluctuations in raisin supply. This type\nof situation introduces a certain amount\nof variability into the raisin market.\nAlthough the size of the crop for raisin-\nvariety grapes may be known, the\namount dried for raisins depends on the\ndemand for crushing. This makes the\nmarketing of raisins a more difficult\ntask. These supply fluctuations can\nresult in producer price instability and\ndisorderly market conditions.\n\nVolume regulation is helpful to the\nraisin industry because it lessens the\nimpact of such fluctuations and\ncontributes to orderly marketing. For\nexample, producer prices for NS raisins\nremained fairly steady from the 1993-94\nthrough the 1997-98 seasons, although\nproduction varied. As shown in the\ntable below, during those years,\nproduction varied from a low of 272,063\ntons in 1996-97 to a high of 387,007\ntons in 1993-94, or about 42 percent.\nAccording to Committee data, the total\nproducer return per ton during those\nyears, which includes proceeds from\nboth free tonnage plus reserve pool\nraisins, has varied from a low of $904.60\nin 1993-94 to a high of $1,049 in 1996-\n97, or 16 percent. Total producer prices\nfor the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons\nincreased significantly due to back-to-\nback short crops during those years.\nProducer prices dropped dramatically\nfor the last three seasons due to record-\n\n"

information\nwebsite Moneyfacts, the choice of cash\nsavings deals on the market reached\nthe highest point in\nDecember since its\nrecords started in 2007.\n\nMore than 2,000 prod-\nucts were available, so\nthere's a lot to unpick.\n\nWhether you are a\nseasoned saver or are\ntaking your first steps into the world\nof investment, Clare Francis, director\nof savings and investments at Barclays\nSmart Investor, above, has tips to help\ngrow a handy pot of cash:\n\nCreate and stick\nto a budget\n\ne importance of a well-structured\nbudget really cannot be overstate:\nsays Clare.\n\nShe suggests reviewir\nmonthly income and outgoings to\nidentify areas where you can cut back\non non-essential spending.\n\n“The money you save can be used to\npay off debts, moved into a savings\naccount, or even invested for your\nfuture,’ Clare adds.\n\n“By taking a proactive approach to\nyour budgeting, you not only ensure\nthat every pound is working as hard as\npossible for you, but that you also\ncultivate a mindset for long-term\nfinancial success:\n\nThere are plenty of free budgeting\ntools available online that could help,\nsuch as the budget planner from the\ngovernment-backed MoneyHelper\nservice at moneyhelperorg.uk.\n\nIt takes about 10 minutes to\ncomplete and can give you a fresh\noutlook and new understanding of\nyour cash.\n\nThink about your\nfinancial goals\n\nYou don’t need to have all your life\ngoals nailed down perfectly, but having\na rough idea of what you're aiming for\nand how much money you'll need is\nhelpful” says Clare.\n\n“It provides a useful starting point\nto weigh up the best options available\nto you.”\n\nMany people keep all their cash in\nsavings accounts.\n\nBut Clare suggests that if you've got\nmoney you can afford to put away for\nthe longer term, perhaps for five years\nor more, then investing could be worth\nconsidering.\n\nMoney held in investments may\npotentially see stronger growth over\nthe longer-term than savings held\nin cash.\n\nBut people putting money into\ninvestments will need to be comfort-\nable with the risks and be aware that\nthey could potentially get less money\nback than they put in.\n\nAnalysis by Barclays indi-\ncates that many savers 44\ncould be missing out on\npotentially higher returns.\n\nIt estimates that 13\nmillion UK adults hold\n£430billion of “possible\ninvestments” in cash\nsavings, so they could be\nmissing out on a lot of extra\n\nPound cost\naveraging can\nhelp smooth\nout overall\nreturns and\nreduce the risk\n\nmoney if only they felt more confident\nand empowered to invest.\n\nConsider how\nhands-on you\nwant to be\n\nChoosing where and how to invest\nmoney can feel daunting, which may\nfor some people be a barrier to moving\nsome of their money from cash savings\ninto investments.\n\n“Many people face a\nchoice paralysis, where\nthey are afraid of making\nthe wrong decision, and it\nprevents them from taki\nthe next step,” Clare\nexplains.\n\nShe also highlights the\nfact many providers offer\nready-made investments\n\nfunds, which may be a good place to\nstart for some people.\n\n“These types of funds provide global\ndiversification and invest in a mixture\nof cash, bonds and shares but the\nlevels of risk vary,’ explains Clare.\n\n“So, all you need to do is to pick a\nfund with a level of risk that youre\ncomfortable with”\n\nLook for financial\nguidance from\nreputable sources\n\nClare says: “Our recent research found\nthat a quarter of Brits are now turning\nto social media, community messaging\napps and online forums for\ninformation about investing”\n\nClare suggests that when looking at\ncontent from a financial influencer, or\n“finfluencer,’ check out their bio to see\n\nif they have a background in finance\nor experience in the investment field.\n\n“If you struggle to reassure yourself\nthat they know what they are talking\nabout, be cautious about acting on\ntheir guidance,’ she says.\n\nShe also warns that, with many\ninvestment scams starting on social\nmedia, it is important to “sense check”\nany information that is being\nshared online.\n\nConsider whether claims about high\ninvestment returns, for example, seem\ntoo good to be true.\n\nIt is crucial to keep in mind as well\nthat fraudsters may use deepfake\nvideos or other bogus information to\ngive the false impression that an\ninvestment scheme has been endorsed\nby celebrities.\n\nIf youre unsure about a particular\nfirm, remember that regulator the\n\nFinancial Conduct Authorityhas a\nwarning list of firms on its website as\nwell as a financial services register of\nfirms and people involved in regulated\nactivities (fca.org.uk).\n\nRegular\nsaving\nand investin\n\n“Just as saving monthh\nis a good habit to get\ninto, so is investing\nregularly,’ says Clare.\n“Many people |\nthink you need a\nlarge amount before\nyou can start, but\nthat’s not the case”\nDripping regula\namounts of money i\ninvestments over\n\nOt Te, NS\n\ntte\n"

He was successful\nin federating a variety of social\ncategories: reactionary Catholics\nand pagan romantics, skinheads\nand members of the haute\nbourgeoisie, unemployed factory\nworkers in the north and well-\nheeled wine growers in the Midi.\n\nBorn in the Breton fishing village\nof La Trinite-sur-Mer, he had the\nbirth name of Jean. He reportedly\nchanged it when he first stood for\nelection. His parents were Jean, a\nfisherman who died after a mine\nwas caught in his net when his\nson was 14, and Anne-Marie (nee\nHervé), aseamstress.\n\nAt university in Paris, he studied\npolitics and law, and led a rightwing\nstudent group with a reputation for\nviolent and racist behaviour. It was\nwidely thought that the loss of his\nleft eye was the result of a fight, and\nhis account of the circumstances\nvaried over the years. More recently\nhe said it was the result of an\naccident while he was erecting a\nmarquee for a political meeting.\n\nIn 1953, he volunteered for\nmilitary service in Indochina, now\nVietnam, enrolling as a parachutist\nin the Foreign Legion and\nattending officer training school.\nDemobilised after two years, at the\nage of 27 he became his country’s\nyoungest member of parliament as\na backer of Pierre Poujade, whose\nsupport for small shopkeepers\nand businessmen, and hostility\nto tax prefigured elements of Le\nPen’s later policies. He soon fell out\nwith Poujade, and in 1956 again\nenlisted, serving in north Africa.\nAllegations that he was involved\nin the torture of Algerian prisoners\ndogged him for years.\n\nRe-elected in 1958, he lost his\nparliamentary seat in 1962 and\nspent most of the 1960s engaged\nin far-right politics and in running\na business devoted to the sale of\nrecordings of rightwing political\nfigures. In 1972, he founded the\nFN, and two years later made his\nfirst presidential bid.\n\nLe Pen’s circumstances were\ntransformed in 1976 when Hubert\nLambert, a wealthy admirer,\ndied and left him a fortune and\na mansion in Paris. Lambert was\nheir to a cement fortune, but was\nphysically frail, with psychological\ntroubles. For years there was\ncontroversy over the manner of his\ndeath at 42. Members of his family\nsought to have the will annulled,\nand eventually the legacy was split\nwith another claimant.\n\nLe Pen’s new wealth did not\nenable him to find enough sponsors\nto run for president in 1981, but\nthroughout the 1980s and 90s\nelections showed considerable\nunderlying support: 14.3% in the\n1988 presidential vote, 15% in 1995;\n\nos\n\nih.\n\neel\noe a :\n= 4 oA | Y\n— ofl\nJ [’\n\nL L\n\na\n\ney,\n\na : F\n\nthe visit of the Tunisian president\n\nHabib Bourguiba in 1961.

In the legislative\nelections that followed, his\ncandidates scored respectably\nbut won no parliamentary seats.\nInevitably, the question of his\nsuccession arose, but Le Pen made\nit clear he planned to continue: with\nthe presidential term reduced to five\nyears, he would be a mere 79 in 2007.\n\nMarine was given an enhanced\nrole, to the discontent of some of\n\nAa\n\nTensions\nthen emerged\n\nbetween Marine and\n\nher father and there\nfollowed a battle for\nthe soul of the FN\n\nTop, Le Pen during a protest against\n\nhis older and more traditionally\nminded supporters. After the\ndefection of his chief lieutenant,\nBruno Mégret, in the late 90s, no\nobvious successors emerged: none\nof the possible contenders hada\nfraction of his charisma.\n\nMarine took as a priority the\ntask of humanising her father’s\nimage, and began increasingly to\ntake over as his political heir. She\nset about “de-demonising” the FN,\nand became an altogether more\nformidable figure, with Jean-Marie\nmarginalised in the battle for the\nsoul and legacy of their party.\n\nIn September 2024, father and\ndaughter were among 25 people\ncharged with embezzling funds for\nfake jobs for European parliament\nassistants between 2004 and 2016.\nJean-Marie’s health had been poor,\nand he did not appear in court. The\nverdicts are expected shortly.\n\nHe married Pierrette Lalanne in\n1960, and they had three daughters,\nMarie-Caroline, Yann and Marine.\n\nAfter an acrimonious divorce\nin 1987, Pierrette denounced Le\nPen, and posed for Playboy when\nhe refused to pay alimony. In 1991\nhe married Jany (Jeanne-Marie)\nPaschos.

In 2022 she completed\na master’s in social research at\nYork University, graduating with\na distinction. Her dissertation\nlooked at the impact on the arts\nprofessionals delivering such\nschemes, and how they might\nbe better supported.\n\nWhile she loved North Yorkshire,\nshe was acutely aware of the issue\nof rural isolation. She had moved\ntowards improving opportunities\nto help cultural industries thrive in\nthe countryside. Helen and I had\nestablished our own company -\nRyedale Creative - and at the time\nof her death were looking at a range\nof feasibility studies focusing on\ncreative rural centres.\n\nHelen loved dance and\nperformance, and was constantly\ndreaming up projects, including\nrunning Coquette, a burlesque and\ncabaret night in York, for a number\nof years. She also performed\nin burlesque events across the\ncountry, and had an affinity for\nballet and Bollywood dancing.\n\nBorn in Bridgend, south Wales,\nto Liz (nee Williams), a nursery\nnurse, and Barry Mahoney, a\npilot, Helen went to Porthcawl\ncomprehensive school.

    "pred": "Federal Register/Vol. 81, No. 194/Thursday, October 6, 2016/Rules and Regulations\n\n69433\n\nTwo Kentucky Cave Beetles (Louisville\nCave Beetle (Pseudanophthalmus\ntroglodytes) and Tatum Cave Beetle\n(Pseudanophthalmus parvus)\n\nPrevious Federal Actions\n\nThe Louisville cave beetle and Tatum\nCave beetle were added to the Federal\nlist of candidate species in the\nNovember 15, 1994, CNOR (59 FR\n58982) as Category 2 species. Category\n2 candidate species were identified as\nthose taxa for which the Service\npossessed information indicating\nproposing to list the taxa was possibly\nappropriate, but for which conclusive\ndata on biological vulnerability and\nthreats sufficient to support a proposed\nlisting rule was lacking. The February\n28, 1996, CNOR (61 FR 7596)\ndiscontinued recognition of categories,\nso both species were no longer\nconsidered candidate species and were\ntherefore removed from the candidate\nlist.\n\nIn the October 30, 2001, CNOR, the\nService re-evaluated both cave beetle\nspecies, and placed them back on the\ncandidate list through the Service’s own\ninternal process with an LPN of 5 (66 FR\n54808). The Service received a petition\nrom the Center for Biological Diversity\nand others, dated May 11, 2004, to list\neight cave beetles, including the\nLouisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave\nbeetle, as endangered or threatened\nspecies. In the May 11, 2005, CNOR (70\nFR 24870), the Service determined that\nisting the Louisville cave beetle and\nTatum Cave beetle was warranted but\nrecluded by higher priority listing\ndecisions. Further, we have included\nboth species addressed in this finding in\nevery CNOR since 2001 (see October 30,\n2001 (66 FR 54808); June 13, 2002 (67\nFR 40657); May 4, 2004 (69 FR 24876);\nMay 11, 2005 (70 FR 24870); September\n12, 2006 (71 FR 53756), December 6,\n2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008\n73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR\n57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR\n69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370),\nNovember 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994),\nNovember 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104),\nDecember 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and\nDecember 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584)).\n\nBackground\n\nThese two species are small (about 4\nmm (0.16 in) in length), predatory cave\nbeetles that occupy moist habitats\ncontaining organic matter transported\nrom sources outside the cave\nenvironment. Members of the\nPseudanophthalmus genus vary in\nrarity from fairly widespread species\nthat are found in many caves to species\nthat are extremely rare and commonly\nrestricted to one or only a few cave\n\nhabitats. The Louisville cave beetle is\nrestricted to four caves in Jefferson\nCounty, Kentucky, while the Tatum\nCave beetle is known from one cave\n(Tatum Cave) in Marion County,\nKentucky.\n\nSummary of Status Review\n\nWhen the Louisville cave beetle and\nTatum Cave beetle were identified as\ncandidates for protection under the Act\nin the October 30, 2001, CNOR (66 FR\n54808), the Service considered both\nspecies to be vulnerable to toxic\nchemical spills, discharges of large\namounts of polluted water, closure or\nalterations of cave entrances, and the\ndisruption of cave energy processes by\nhighway construction and industrial,\nresidential, and commercial\ndevelopment. Our general perception\nwas that both species were vulnerable to\nthese habitat stressors, and we\nsuspected that these stressors were\nsignificant and the species’ overall\npopulation trends were likely\ndecreasing. We also noted the lack of\nState or Federal regulations to\nameliorate those threats. In the May 11,\n2005, CNOR (70 FR 24870), we noted\nboth species’ limited distribution and\nhow that would increase their\nvulnerability to isolated events that\nwould have only a minimal effect on\nmore wide-ranging members of the\ngenus Pseudanophthalmus. Both\nspecies were assigned an LPN of 5.\n\nLouisville Cave Beetle\n\nOver the last 2 years, field surveys for\nthe Louisville cave beetle have provided\nnew information on the species’\ndistribution and stressors. Based on this\nnew information, we have re-examined\nthe species’ status and re-evaluated the\nmagnitude and imminence of its threats.\nLewis and Lewis confirmed the\ncontinued presence of P. troglodytes in\nEleven Jones Cave (a period of 20 years)\nand observed the species in three new\ncaves (Sauerkraut Cave, Cave Hill Cave,\nand Cave Creek Cave), demonstrating\nthat the species is more abundant and\nwidespread than previously believed.\nThe species was difficult to find in each\nof these caves (one to four individuals\nobserved), but this is not unusual for the\ngenus Pseudanophthalmus, which is\noften difficult to find and is frequently\nobserved in low numbers. Population\nestimates or discernable trends for these\npopulations have not been possible due\nto the low number of individuals\nobserved and the difficulty in finding\nspecimens during repeat visits. We\nacknowledge that caves within the\nspecies’ range likely continue to be\naffected by many of the same stressors\nidentified by previous investigators:\n\nreduced energy inputs, sedimentation,\npollution, and human visitation.\nHowever, we have no evidence that\nthese stressors are operative threats that\nare adversely affecting P. troglodytes at\na population level.\n\nTatum Cave Beetle\n\nWith respect to the Tatum Cave\nbeetle, we have no evidence suggesting\nthat the species is still extant in Tatum\nCave. The species was relatively\nabundant (20 individuals) in Tatum\nCave when first observed by C. H.\nKrekeler in 1957, but the species\nappeared to be less common in 1965,\nwhen T. C. Barr observed only two\nindividuals. Since 1965, extensive\nsurveys of Tatum Cave have been\ncompleted on eight separate occasions,\nusing search techniques similar to those\nused by C. H. Krekeler and T. C. Barr\n(i.e., methodical visual searches of all\navailable habitats). Three of these\nsurvey efforts also involved the use of\nbaited pitfall traps (small cups buried in\nthe substrate and baited with limburger\ncheese) placed in several locations\nwithin Tatum Cave for a period of one\nweek. Despite all of these searches, no\nTatum Cave beetles have been observed\nin Tatum Cave since the last observation\nby Barr in 1965 (a period of 51 years).\n\nThe Tatum Cave beetle is small in size\nand may be more difficult to locate than\nsome cave organisms; however, both\nKrekeler and Barr were able to find the\nspecies using methodical, visual\nsearches of suitable habitats in Tatum\nCave. Subsequent researchers have used\nidentical search methods on eight\nseparate occasions in the exact same\nhabitats within Tatum Cave, but no\nTatum Cave beetles have been observed.\nTherefore, based on our review of the\nbest available scientific and commercial\ninformation, the Service believes the\nTatum Cave beetle to be extinct. We\nacknowledge that it is difficult, if not\nimpossible, to verify a species’\nextinction. There is considerable\nuncertainty about the actual status of\nthe species, and we acknowledge that,\nas suggested by Lewis and Lewis, there\nis some chance that the species remains\nextant but occurs in low numbers and\nis simply undetectable using traditional\nsearch methods. However, considering\nthe best available scientific and\ncommercial information, we believe that\nit is reasonable to conclude that the\nspecies is extinct. The Service\nencourages continued surveys for the\nTatum Cave beetle in Tatum Cave, as\ntime and funding allow. If the species is\nsubsequently found to be extant, we can\nreevaluate its legal status under the Act\nin the future.\n\n"

ARMANDOL. SANCHEZ/CHICAGO TRIBUNE PHOTOS,\n\nBULLS TAKEAWAYS\n\nSuitable for framing\n\nWith dunk, White\nput Wembanyama\non a poster to lead\ncomeback win\n\nBy Julia Poe\nChicago Tribune\n\nCoby White is not a dunker.\n\nBefore Monday’s 114-110 win\nover the San Antonio Spurs, the\nBulls guard had attempted only\ntwo dunks this season. He dunked\nonly 14 times last season. It’s just\nnot a part of his bag that White\nlikes to dig into often.\n\nMaybe, he joked after the win,\nhe would try it more ifhe had the\nathleticism of Zach LaVine or the\nwingspan of Patrick Williams.\n\nBut in the final 30 seconds,\nwith a one-point lead over the\nSpurs, White didn’t have another\nchoice. So he put his head down\nand charged to the rim. And ifthe\ntallest man in the NBA was in his\nway? Well, all the better.\n\nVictor Wembanyama already\nhad blocked three of White’s\nshots before the final minute, but\nthat didn’t slow White’s approach.\nItcouldn’t. After falling behind by\n19 points in the first half the Bulls\ncouldn’t collapse at the rim just\nbecause the 7-foot-3 Wemban-\nyama was waiting.\n\nIn the locker room at halftime,\nthe entire Bulls roster shared the\nsame sentiment: We have to do\nsomething.\n\nFor White, that something\nmeant attacking the rim. Even if\nhe got blocked. And in the final\nminute, that fearlessness paid off\ntwofold.\n\nWhite slung an up-and-under\nshot that arched all the way over\nWembanyama’s 8-foot wingspan\nand into the basket to give the\nBulls the lead with 47 seconds\nremaining. And 32 seconds later,\nWhite took an even more aggres-\nsive approach, getting Jeremy\nSochan to bite on apump fake and\nlaunching himself skyward.\n\nWembanyama rotated over a\nsecond late. That didn’t matter\neither. For White, the poster-per-\nfect shot — his arm cocked back,\nWembanyama’s body crashing\ninto his torso, the ball already\nsearing downward toward the\n\na\n\nBulls guard Zach LaVine slides on the court during the fourth quarter\nagainst the Spurs on Monday night.\n\nrim — was the only option to\nclinch the game.\n\n“Tjust told myself the next time\nI was going to go, I was going to\ntry to dunk it,’ White said. “I\nknew when I was driving, if I was\ngoing to lay it in, finger-roll it,\nanything, he was going to block\nit. So I just was like — I’ve got to\ndunk it. [just wanted to make sure\nthat I got the basket.”\n\nHere are two other takeaways\nfrom the win.\n\n1. Wemby vs. Vooch: The tough-\nest matchup of the game was\nbetween Wembanyama and\nBulls center Nikola Vuéevi¢.\nFrom the start, it was a challenge\nfor Vuéevié — Wembanyama\nblocked him twice in the first four\nminutes, enforcing his will under\nand around the rim.\nWembanyama didn’t affect\nVuéevié too deeply on the offen-\nsive side. The veteran extended\nhis consistent scoring, tallying 24\npoints despite an off night (2-for-\n9) behind the 3-point arc. But\nWembanyama proved equally\nvexing on the other end, making\nfour 3-pointers to score 23 points.\nIn the final two minutes of the\nsecond quarter, Vucevi¢ chased\nWembanyama out to the 3-point\nline, doggedly latched onto the\nSpurs center’s hip until the shot\nclock expired. But in the final\nhalf-second, Wembanyama\npulled up and fired offa3-pointer\nthat rattled through the rim — his\n\nsecond of the night.\n\nVuéevié could only drop his\narms and tip his head back in\nstupefied frustration, jogging\nback before answering with his\nown 3-pointer several possessions\nlater.\n\nWembanyama closed the game\nwith an identical play in the final\n10 seconds. This time, the shot\nrattled out. And for Vuéevié¢, that\nwas victory enough — forcing\nWembanyama into his worst shot\nfor the game-winner.\n\n2.Zach LaVine brought the high-\nlights: It’s hard to fly under the\nradar while consistently putting\nup 30 or more points, but LaVine\nis achieving just that. He finished\njust shy ofa triple-double by tally-\ning 35 points, 11 rebounds and\neight assists — and threw down\na few spectacle dunks of his own\n— to once again power the Bulls\noffense.\n\nHis scoring was vital on a cold\nnight from 3-point range. The\nBulls went 13-for-39 behind the\narc — and LaVine and White\ncombined for six of those makes.\nThe Spurs were able to utilize\nWembanyama’s overwhelming\nlength around the basket to crash\ncloseouts heavily, funneling the\nBulls offense toward their center\nat the rim.\n\nLaVine was the offense’s key\nspark inside the arc, pushing the\nball in transition to utilize his\nspeed advantage.\n\nCHICAGO BASKETBALL REPORT\n\nNo All-Stars for\nBulls yet again?\n\nSky hire former\nDream head coach as\nassistant under Marsh\n\nBy Julia Poe\nChicago Tribune\n\nThe early returns of the NBA\nAll-Star fan voting do not look\ngood for the Chicago Bulls.\n\nNo Bulls player was listed in the\nfirst returns of fan voting, which\nwill run until Jan. 20. While the\nBoston Celtics and the Philadel-\nphia 76ers are dominating the\nfan vote, actual selections could\nvary greatly — fan voting is only\nweighted as 50% of total voting.\nMedia and player selections will\nalso contribute to the final 2025\nAll-Star team rosters.\n\nThe Bulls have not sent a player\nto the All-Star game since 2023,\nwhen DeMar DeRozan was the\nteam’s sole representative in the\ngame. Last season broke a three-\nyear streak of consecutive All-Star\nappearances from either DeRozan\nor Zach LaVine. The team’s lack of\npresence at the All-Star game has\noften been a visible reflection of a\nlack of relevance in the league at\nlarge.\n\nThis season, veterans LaVine\nand Nikola Vuéevi¢ might be flying\nunder the radar as potential selec-\ntions for the All-Star game. Vucevié\nis boosting his scoring with the\nbest 3-point shooting season of his\ncareer. And LaVine is averaging\nthe 12th-most points of any player\nin the Eastern Conference (ninth\nof backcourt players in the East)\nwhile showcasing his efficiency in\na revised version of his role as the\noffensive leader for the Bulls.\n\nAll-Star starters will be\nannounced on Jan. 23 and the\nreserve team will be announced\non Jan. 30. This year’s All-Star\ngame, played in San Francisco,\nwill feature a new format involv-\ning a tournament of four eight-\nplayer teams. Three of those teams\nwill consist of All-Stars while the\nfourth will be the winning team\nfrom the Rising Stars tournament\nfor rookie, second-year and G\nLeague players.\n\nChicago Sky hire former Atlanta\nhead coach Tanisha Wright: New\nSky coach Tyler Marsh made his\nsecond addition to his bench this\nweek, hiring former Atlanta Dream\nhead coach Tanisha Wright as an\nassistant coach.\n\nWright is a 15-year veteran of\nthe WNBA asacoach anda player.\nShe helmed the Dream from 2021\nbefore she was released by the\nteam this fall following a 15-25\nseason. Wright was named the AP\nCoach of the Year in 2022.\n\nPrior to Atlanta, Wright was an\nassistant coach with the Las Vegas\nAces, although she departed for\nthe Dream head coaching position\nbefore current Aces coach Becky\nHammon — who was a crucial\nmentor to Marsh — took over the\nprogram. Wright will bring a vari-\nety of experience to Marsh’s bench\nincluding international scouting.\n\nAyo Dosunmu faces uncertain\nreturn timeline: The Bulls might\nhave to fare without Ayo Dosunmu\nfor an even longer stretch of the\nseason than expected. The guard\ninitially suffered a calf strain in a\noss to the Milwaukee Bucks on\nDec. 23 and has been unable to\nprogress to full-speed sprints after\nan extended 10-day period of rest.\nDosunmu ramped up to sprint-\n\nFormer Dream head coach Tanisha\nWright reacts during the first half of\na first-round WNBA playoff game\nagainst the Liberty on Sept. 24 in\nNew York. ADAM HUNGER/AP\n\ning on a treadmill over the week-\nend but reported discomfort when\nattempting to reach full speed,\ncoach Billy Donovan said. He will\nnotattempt another ramp-up until\nnext week. This means the Bulls\ncould play at least five more games\nwithout Dosunmu, who has been\na crucial defensive anchor and\nsecondary point guard option for\nthe Bulls this season.\n\nIn addition to his contributions\non the court, Dosunmu is a key\ntrade asset for the Bulls as they\napproach a crucial selling season\nahead of the deadline in February.\nWhile he might not be the center of\natrade offer, the Bulls could utilize\nDosunmu’s considerable upside\nand favorable contract to sweeten\na deal.\n\nBefore the injury, Dosunmu was\naveraging 12.6 points, 4.8 assists\nand 3.9 rebounds per game this\nseason.\n\nIllinois climbs to top 15 ranking:\nIn a matter of weeks, the Fighting\nIllini clawed their way from being\nunranked to sitting just outside the\ntop 10 in NCAA men’s basketball\nwith a No. 13 ranking inthe AP Top\n25. This climb was bolstered by the\nteam’s offensive thrashing of No. 15\nOregon, who they beat 109-77 last\nThursday.\n\nIllinois has won its last four\ngames and posted a 3-1 start to the\nBig Ten season. And two of their\nthree losses came at the hands of\na higher-ranked opponent — a\ntwo-point loss to No. 1 Tennessee\nand an early season loss to No. 5\nAlabama. Their lone Big Ten loss\n— an upset by Northwestern —\nwill continue to sting. But Illinois\nis carving outa space for itself as a\ntop contender in the conference,\njostling with Indiana, Michigan\nand Michigan State for the top\nspot.\n\nNumber of the week: 4\n\nZach LaVine is the fourth most\nefficient 3-point shooter in the\nNBA. In big and inconsequential\nmoments alike, LaVine just can’t\nseem to miss. He’s shooting 44.7%\nfrom behind the arc on 74 attempts\nper game.\n\nThis is a somewhat muted\nvolume despite the high rate at\nwhich the Bulls are shooting the\nball from deep this season — but it’s\nalso an anomaly for any player to\nmaintain this high of an efficiency\nwhile taking this many shots. Only\none other player (Kyrie Irving)\nshooting above 44% has taken\n200 or more attempts from 3-point\nrange this season.\n\nOregon guard Jadrian Tracey, left, and Illinois guard Tre White go fora\nrebound during the first half of a game in Eugene, Ore. on Thursday.\nTHOMAS BOYD/AP\n"
