Thus, let 1 ≤ k ≤ n and Cκ be the number of subsets of A with k\nelements.\nFor a fi xed x ∈ A, there are two kinds of subsets of A with k elements: those\nwhich do not contain x and those which do contain x. The former ones are precisely\nn−1\nof\nthese subsets of k elements of A.\nOn the other hand, if B C A has k elements and x ∈ B, then B i {x} C A \\ {x}\nhas k − 1 elements; conversely, if B′ C A \\ {x} has k − 1 elements, then B′U {x } C A\nhas k elements, one of which is x.

Then f ∈ L1 and f = gh by\nProposition (4.36); thus f(ξ) = |U|−1 Ju Xuk(n−1ξ) dn has the desired\nproperties.\n\n(4.51) Theorem. If N C G is closed, then v((N)) = N.\nProof: If ξ ≠ N, take K = {ξ} and W = G \\ N in Lemma (4.50) to\nobtain f ∈ l(N) such that f(ξ) ≠ 0.\n\nWhen G is compact, the other half of the correspondence is easily\nanalyzed. First, a simple lemma that will also be useful elsewhere.\n(4.52) Lemma. If f ∈ L1(G) and ξ ∈ G (C L∞(G)) then f*ξ = f(ξ)ξ.\nProof: For any x ∈ G,\nf ξ(x) =  f(y)(y−x,ξ)dy = (x,ξ)  f(y)(y,ξ)dy = f(ξ)(x,ξ).\n(4.53) Theorem. If G is compact, then i(ν(T)) = I for every closed\nideal I C L1(G).\nProof: Since G is compact, we have G C L∞ C L² C L1. Suppose\nf ∈ i(ν(T)). Then f  ξ = f(ξ)ξ by Lemma (4.52), and either f(ξ) = 0\nor ξ  v(I). In the first case, f * ξ = 0; in the second case, there exists\ng ∈ I such that g(ξ) = 1, so that ξ = g * ξ ∈ I by Lemma (4.52) again.\nIn either case we have f *ξ ∈ I, and hence f *g ∈ I for any g in the linear\nspan of G. The latter is dense in L² by Corollary (4.26), so f * g ∈ I for\nall g ∈ L² since I is closed. Finally, we can take g to be an approximate\nidentity to conclude that f ∈ I.\nWhen G is noncompact, the question of whether l(ν(T)) = I is much\nmore delicate. We now exhibit a simple example to show that the answer\ncan be negative.\n(4.54) Theorem. Let G = Rn with n ≥ 3, and let S be the unit\nsphere in Rn.
