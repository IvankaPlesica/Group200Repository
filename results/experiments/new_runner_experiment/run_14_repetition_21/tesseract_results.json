This convinces me\nthat practically all the ports must have been\nopen, even those as far down as Deck E.\nThe stern did not rise to anything like a\nperpendicular, nor did it rise so high that I\ncould sce a single one of the propellers or\neven the end of her rudder. Not one of\nber funnels fell.\n\nThe last I saw of the lifeboat out of which I\njumped was that she was being pulled down,\nbow first, as the tackle had not been freed\nand the stern of the boat was rising high in\nthe air. While the people were thrown out,\nthey were not so violently thrown as those\nfrom some of the lifeboats that were dropped\nwhen half lowered into the water.\n\nThere was very little vortex; there was\nrather a shooting out from the ship instead\nof a sucking in, after she sank; this I am told\nwas partly caused by the water rushing into\nher funnels and being blown out again by ex-\n\n(1)\n"
