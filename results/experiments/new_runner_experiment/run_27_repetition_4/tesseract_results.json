We would not allow those alien\npower to displace our native languages. The English language\nshould be in harmony with our regional languages, our traditional\nvalues, our socio-cultural set-up etc.\n\ne So we should frame and design the syllabus and prepare the texts\nand contents Indian in concept, colour and spirit with a view to\nhelping our learners to acquire the skills of English language and at\nthe game time to develop in them a sense of belongingness to our\n\n\\ -cultural identities and high regard for Indian realities.\n\nrs should create a congenial teaching- learning situation\ne students are not compelled to learn English but they\n\nard by themselves to acquire the English language and\nnglish literature.\n\n"
